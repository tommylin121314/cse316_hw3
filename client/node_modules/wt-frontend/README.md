## Set Up

1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory of the React web app you are creating

2. Then type `npm install wt-frontend`

3. Make sure you have the peer dependencies installed. If you donâ€™t have these packages installed already, do the following: `npm install sass` and/or `npm install react-router-dom`

4. Change your .css files to .scss and put the following code at the top of the .scss file:

  ```css
  @use 'node_modules/wt-frontend/build/global/wolfie';

  @use 'node_modules/wt-frontend/build/global/components';
